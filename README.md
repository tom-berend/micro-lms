# micro-lms
Middleware for SCORM 2004, for writing SCORM courses OR a backend LMS. No dependencies.

To understand how to make your educational package talk via SCORM, work through
the Jasmine test file.  Then keep watching the console log as you develop and 
test your package.

To build the backend of your LMS, start with the PHP file which assumes that all SCORM
data it receives is clean and consistent.
