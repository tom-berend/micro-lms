# micro-lms
Middleware for a SCORM 2004 LMS.  Useful if you are writing SCORM courses OR backend LMS


To understand how to make your educational package talk via SCORM, start
with the test file and work through it.  Then keep watching the console log as you
test your package, and correct any time you see errors.

To build the backend of your LMS, start with the PHP file which assumes that all SCORM
data it receives is clean and consistent.
